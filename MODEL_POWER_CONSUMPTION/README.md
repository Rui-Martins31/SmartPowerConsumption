# MODEL TO PREDICT POWER CONSUMPTION BASED ON DATE AND TIME

## 1st Model

The first model uses Adam as the optimizer and is using lr=0.001
Epoch [101/200], Train Loss: 0.7867, Val Loss: 0.7779


## 2nd Model

The second model uses SGD as the optimizer and is using lr=0.01
Epoch [100/200], Train Loss: 0.8045, Val Loss: 0.7995


## 3rd Model

The third model uses LSTM to predict output values.
Epoch [200/200], Train Loss: 0.7122
